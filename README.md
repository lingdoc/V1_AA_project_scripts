# Scripts for text analysis

This is a repository for Python scripts used in the project "Verb-initiality cross-linguistically: Insights from Austroasiatic", sponsored by the Swiss National Science Foundation [SNSF100015_176264] from 2018-2021. The repository will be updated as more scripts are made ready for external use. The hope is that the scripts will be of use to the broader (Historical) Linguistic community.

The repository currently contains the following sub-repositories:
1. `Toolbox_scripts` - a set of Python scripts to reformat and replace items in Toolbox dictionaries and interlinearized texts, preserving the interlinear alignment.
